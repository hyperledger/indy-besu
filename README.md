# Indy Besu ledger

## Goals and ideas

* Provide a replacement for [Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) ecosystem that
  provides support for verifiable credentials:
    * Components to replace:
        * Distributed ledger: [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node)
          and [Indy Plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum)
        * Client library: [Indy SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/main)
    * Capability to migrate the data from the original Indy Ledger
* Distributed ledger requirements:
    * Public Permissioned Blockchain
        * Control the validator nodes
        * Control the user permissions
    * EVM compatible Blockchain
        * Capability to deploy on different networks
    * Based on existing open-source blockchain framework with a good performance, sufficient adoption, and wide
      community
    * Capability to work without tokens and fees
    * Stable consensus protocol
* Functional requirements:
    * Interoperability:
        * Capability to use existing DID's and identifiers:
            * Support [indy](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/) DID method
            * Support [sov](https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html) DID method
            * Identifiers previously stored on the client side should be resolvable on the new Ledger
        * Capability to use the ledger as
          an [AnonCreds Registry](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-methods-registry/)
        * Compatibility with the latest [AnonCreds Specification](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/)
    * Extensibility:
        * Capability to integrate new pieces of functionality easily
        * Capability to
          use [ETHR](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md) DID
          method
            * Integration with the [AnonCreds Registry](https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-methods-registry/)
            * Integration with `Permissioned` modules
    * Do only basic state consistency validation

## Design documentation

See [design document](./docs/README.md) covering the main ledger aspects.

## Running local network

### Prerequisites

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) v2 or higher

> ⚠️ **Note**: If on MacOS or Windows, please ensure that you allow docker to use upto 4G of memory under the
_Resources_ section. The [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
> and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) sites have details on how to do this at the "
> Resources" heading

### Commands

* **Start the network: - run all services inside the docker containers**
    ```bash
    ./network/scripts/run.sh
    ```
* **Start the network with Blocksout explorer: - run all services inside the docker containers**
    ```bash
    ./network/scripts/run.sh --blockscout
    ```
  or
    ```bash
    ./network/scripts/run.sh -b
    ```

* **Stop the network: run the entire network, and you can resume where it left off with `./resume.sh`**
    ```bash
    ./network/scripts/stop.sh
    ```

* **Remove the network: stop and then remove all containers and images**
    ```bash
    ./network/scripts/remove.sh
    ```

## Managing smart contracts

See [README.md](/smart_contracts/README.md).

## Client library

[Rust library](./vdr/README.md) representing a convenient client for connecting to an Indy-Besu node, building and
executing transactions and queries.
