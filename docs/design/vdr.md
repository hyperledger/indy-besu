# VDR Design

**Disclaimer:** popular packages for working with Ethereum network are very close to `indy-sdk`: their provide tide
modules for the whole flow execution. It may be difficult to reuse only particular functions without full integration.
In the same, time Indy community follows to idea of splitting complex library into components.

> Rust client library to work with Web3, Solidity smart contracts: https://github.com/tomusdrw/rust-web3

## VDR library assumptions

* VDR library firstly will be implemented independently and later integrate into existing indy vdr/sdk/frameworks.
* VDR library will be written in Rust with providing language wrappers.
* VDR library does conversion of legacy `sov/indy` formatted did's and id's into `indy2` format.
* VDR library does conversion of ledger formatted entities (DID Document, Schema, Credential Definition) into
  specifications compatible format.
* VDR library does only basic validation within request builders.
* VDR library does only Ethereum base account signing of transactions.
* VDR library request builders are tide to the network.
* VDR library will work with RPC Node over HTTP.

## Transaction flow example

### Writes

```
client = indy_vdr_create_client(chain_id, node_address, contracts_path)
did_document = {}
transaction = indy_vdr_build_create_did_transaction(client.contract, from, did_document, options): Transaction
signature = external_wallet_method_to_secp256k1_sign(transaction.data, private_key)
transaction.set_signature(signature)
indy_vdr_submit_transaction(client, transaction)
```

### Reads

```
client = indy_vdr_create_client(chain_id, node_address, contracts_path)
did = ""
transaction = indy_vdr_build_resolve_did_transaction(client.contract, did, options): Transaction
indy_vdr_submit_transaction(client, transaction)
```

## Wallet: Transaction signing

* **Algorithm:** `ECDSA` - elliptic curve digital signature.
    * `recoverable`? - public key can be recovered from the signature
* **Key Types:** - `Secp256k1`
* Steps:
    * `hash = keccak256.Hash(data)`
    * `signature = Secp256k1.sign(hash).`
    * `hex(signature)`
